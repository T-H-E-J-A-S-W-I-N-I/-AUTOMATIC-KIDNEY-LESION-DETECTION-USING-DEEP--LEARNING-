# AUTOMATIC-KIDNEY-LESION-DETECTION-USING-DEEP--LEARNING

A kidney lesion is a generic term to describe an area of kidney tissue that deviates from normal, healthy tissue. In simple terms, a kidney lesion is kidney tissue that is abnormal in some way. 
There are quite a few reasons a person may develop one or more lesions on either or both of their kidneys during their lifetime.

## OBJECTIVE:

The project focuses on these objectives, which are: 

● To suggest ways to detect kidney lesions using a CT scan.  

● To develop a system that uses CT scan images as a way to detect kidney lesions accurately. 

● To give a comparative analysis for classification performance accuracy of kidney lesion detection using the deep learning models will be reviewed comprehensively. 

● To develop an automatic approach for kidney lesion diagnosis utilizing the CT scan images is a very useful tool that helps the experts. 

● The proposed deep learning architecture will be formulated for the automatic detection of kidney lesions by recognizing CT scan images.

## Software Requirements :

• OS — Windows10  

• Software — Jupiter Notebook, PyCharm
